# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "Since its discovery at the LHC in 2012, a number of studies have shown that the Higgs boson has properties very similar to those predicted by the Standard Model. However, virtually no experimental information exists about the Higgs self-coupling, which has important consequences for understanding the electroweak phase transition and physics beyond the Standard Model. In this talk, I will discuss how future proton colliders could measure the Higgs self-coupling and give us insight into early universe cosmology. I will start with a review of Higgs physics and how the self-coupling is related to electroweak symmetry breaking and hence the early universe phase transition. I will then describe how the self-coupling can be measured via Higgs pair production at a hadron collider and summarize the current limits, focusing on the hh-bbϒϒ decay channel. Finally, I will review previous studies on the capabilities of a 100 TeV collider such as FCC-hh at CERN or SPPC in China and preview our results on the capabilities of a 27 TeV collider such as HE-LHC."
