I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the <a href=https://hetg.physics.harvard.edu>Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature at Harvard University</a>, working with Professor <a href=http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~mreece/>Matthew Reece</a> on various topics in High Energy Theory and Particle Phenomenology. Prior to joining the group at Harvard, I obtained my Ph.D. as a part of the <a href=http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu>C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics (YITP)</a> at Stony Brook University, working with Professor <a href=http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~meade>Patrick Meade</a>. I also spent some time as a visitor at Brookhaven National Laboratory working with Sally Dawson as part of the DOE SCGSR (Graduate Student Research) Program. I did my undergraduate work at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign where I graduated in 2015 with a B.S. in Physics and a B.S. in Mathematics.
