 abstract = {We present a systematic spurion setup called Aligned Flavor Violation (AFV) that allows for new physics couplings to quarks that are aligned with the Standard Model (SM) Yukawas, but do not necessarily share their hierarchies nor are family universal. Additionally, we show that there is an important subset of AFV called Spontaneous Flavor Violation (SFV), which naturally arises from UV completions where the quark family number and CP groups are spontaneously broken. Flavor-changing neutral currents are strongly suppressed in SFV extensions of the SM. We study SFV from an effective field theory perspective and demonstrate that SFV new physics with significant and preferential couplings to first or second generation quarks may be close to the TeV scale.},
